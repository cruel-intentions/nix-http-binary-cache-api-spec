# Nix HTTP Binary Cache OpenAPI Specification
An [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification for a Nix HTTP Binary Cache.

The _spec_ is hosted at [https://fzakaria.github.io/nix-http-binary-cache-api-spec](https://fzakaria.github.io/nix-http-binary-cache-api-spec/#/) for you to play with.


ðŸ˜¢ Unfortunately since most Nix HTTP binary caches don't have any CORS policies, you will be unable to actually execute the APIs from the site unless your browser has CORS disabled.
